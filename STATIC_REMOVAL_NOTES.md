# Static Site Removal

## Changes Made

This Cloudflare Worker has been modified to remove static site serving functionality. The following changes were made:

### Removed:
- Static site file bundling and serving
- `STATIC_SITE_FILES` constant
- `getStaticFile()` function  
- `serveStaticFile()` function (replaced with inline admin HTML)
- Static file serving logic in main fetch handler
- Homepage fallback serving
- Build script references in package.json

### Preserved:
- Complete IP API functionality (JSON, CSV, HTML, XML, YAML, text endpoints)
- Admin panel for visitor analytics (now uses inline HTML)
- Visitor logging to D1 database
- CORS headers for API usage
- All existing API routes and functionality

### Current Behavior:
- All API endpoints work exactly as before
- Root path (`/`) now returns JSON response with IP information
- Previously static file paths (like `/index.html`, `/css/style.css`) now return JSON responses
- Admin panel still accessible via generated admin path
- No static file serving capability

### Files No Longer Used:
- `build-static.js` - Static site build script
- `public/` directory - Previously contained static site files
- `static-files.js` - Generated bundle file

### Purpose:
This change enables the API to be embedded in external websites via JavaScript/AJAX requests without serving a competing static site interface.
